Other than for fun, the purpose of this code is to provide a baseline for testing machine learning alogorithms. If you want to use this code to test your own algorithms, just rewrite the guess method in AI_View.py and return a guess string in alphanumeric format (i.e. 'A10', 'E5') Have fun!

GameLoop

* Program entry point

* Test mode

* Game mode

* Manages player turns


GameLogic

* Tracks ship locations

* Records hits sustained by each ship

* Knows number of ships still floating 

* Prevents ships from overlapping during placement

* Processes fire orders from player and AI


HumanView

* Guides player's ship placement

* Allows player to issue fire order


GameGrid

* Displays AI and Player grids

* Displays Player only grid for initial ship placement


AI_View

* Randomly places its ships on the grid

* Decision system makes guesses

* Contains __test_setup method that displays all
  AI ships on the grid


View

* Base class for each type of player interface

* Generates a complete ship

* Contains ship overlap detection logic


GameLoop

* manages turns between AI and Player

* determines when to display results and grid

* contains testMode method that auto plays
